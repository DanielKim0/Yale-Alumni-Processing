This program requires python modules pandas and tk to work.

It inputs a valid csv file of alumni with an "event" column that lists out, separated by a comma and a space, each event that the alumnus went to. It outputs in a "results" folder valid alumnus, event, and attendance csv files to be uploaded in the Yale Alumni Database. Note that the attendance csv file must be uploaded last.
